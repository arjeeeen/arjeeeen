## Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
I'm super passionate about technology, especially information technology, if you really want to know about Cybersecurity.

I have completed various courses, the most important being the one carried out with EPICODE which was able to issue me targeted certificates in the sector.

Currently I have fun creating small scripts and webapps, looking for vulnerabilities and studying existing ones. I love bugs.
